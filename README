Sakila Restful Search Sample
============================

This sample demonstrates the use of FIQL based search implementation in CXF JAX-RS(http://cxf.apache.org/).
Sakila(http://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila.html) is a sample database provided by MySQL and the search
queries are performed on this database.

Some of the sample search queries are :

http://localhost:9000/sakila/searchActors?_s=firstname==PENELOPE  =>
SELECT * FROM actor WHERE firstname = 'PENELOPE'

http://localhost:9000/sakila/searchActors?_s=actorid=ge=15 =>
SELECT * FROM actor WHERE actorid >= '15'

http://localhost:9000/sakila/searchActors?_s=lastupdate=le=2010-03-11T18:00:00.000%2B00:00 =>
SELECT * FROM actor WHERE lastupdate <= 'Thu Mar 11 11:00:00 MST 2010'

http://localhost:9000/sakila/searchActors?_s=lastupdate=ge=2006-02-11T18:00:00.000%2B00:00;firstname==JOHNNY  =>
